THE TEAM

Dzmitry Suslau Founding Director &amp; Curator
Dzmitry is a teaching fellow and a PhD candidate at UCL. Having contributed to
exhibition research at the V&amp;A (David Bowie is) and as a freelance curator (documentary
exhibition Eastern Europe in Drag and others) he has long had an interest in art’s connection
with personal, collective and social issues. He explored these topics through the work on
public programmes and festivals, including the V&amp;A Friday Late and queer arts festivals in
Sweden and Eastern Europe. Since 2016 his research has been focused on human ecology,
critical issues in public art and a broader connection between culture and climate change,
which he addressed in a series of guest lectures internationally.
