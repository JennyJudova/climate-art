    <h2>Dzmitry Suslau</h2>
    <h3>Founding Director &amp; Curator</h3>
    <p> Dzmitry is a teaching fellow and a PhD candidate at UCL. Having contributed to exhibition research at the V&A
      and other cultural institutions he has long had an interest in art’s connection with personal, collective and
      social issues. He explored these topics through the work on public programmes and festivals, including the V&A
      Friday Late and queer arts festivals in Sweden and Eastern Europe. Since 2016 his research has been focused on
      human ecology, critical issues in public art and a broader connection between culture and climate change, which he
      addressed in a series of guest lectures internationally.</p>
