    <h2>Dzmitry Suslau</h2>
    <h3>Founding Director &amp; Curator</h3>
    <p> Dzmitry is a lecturer and a PhD candidate at UCL. Having contributed to exhibition research at the V&A
      and other cultural institutions he has long had an interest in art’s connection with personal, collective and
      social issues. He explored these topics through the work on public programmes and festivals, including the V&A
      Friday Late and queer arts festivals in Sweden and Eastern Europe. Since 2016 his research has been focused on
      human ecology, critical issues in public art and a broader connection between culture and climate change, which he
      addressed in a series of guest lectures internationally.</p>

    <h2>Jevgenija Ravcova</h2>
    <h3>Managing Director</h3>
    <p>
      Jevgenija has a background in art history (MA Courtauld Institute of Art) and several years’ experience creating
      and managing collaborative cultural projects with partners nationally and internationally.
      Recently, she has delivered a major heritage preservation research project with global
      partners such as UNESCO, Palace Museum in Beijing, The Louvre, The Smithsonian
      Institution and others. Her most recent project with partners in Dubai focuses on food
      security and sustainability in the face of climate change. Jevgenija has
      worked at Christie’s London and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.
