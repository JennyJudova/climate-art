        <summary>Against Our Vanishing is a free audio trail that uncovers the LGBTQ+ history and culture of Rye. Delve
          into the rich queer undercurrents of the town in the company of its famous writers and artists like Henry
          James and Radclyffe Hall. Walk in the footsteps of the queer people of Rye, whose lives are interwoven with
          its streets and East Sussex’s vanishing coastline.</summary>
