        <p>Working in consultation with the groundbreaking design-led engineering firm <a href="https://www.akt-uk.com/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKT II</a>, he will build a temporary
          bamboo structure in the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. Responding to the local landscape, it will serve as a
          space for different community groups to come together.</p>

        <summary>Mo Langmuir strives to break down the binary between art and science through collaboration with local
          communities. Alistair Debling examines diverse themes through his interdisciplinary work, from queer nightlife
          and ecology to the military-industrial complex and its architectures.</summary>
        <p>Mo’s work at Climate Art will centre around balloon mapping and marine sampling. Working with Rye’s resident
          groups to map out sites for biological sampling, Mo will use microscopy to generate beautiful interpretations
          of the invisible elements of the local landscape threatened by climate change.</p>
        <img src="mo-behind-scenes.jpeg" alt="Artist Mo Langmuir at work.">
        <p>Mo’s studio is half research lab, half artist atelier, and on 3 May, she’ll
          be opening it up to the public for a virtual tour, sharing methodologies, sampling
          equipment, mapping tools and sketches.</p>
        <p> Alistair’s project will investigate Rye’s rich military history as a fortified town,
          in tandem with its historical and contemporary energy and environmental defence
          infrastructure. This work will help us (re)think what defence, protection and
          fortification of the landscape mean in the age of climate breakdown.</p>
        <img src="alistair-headshot-landscape.jpeg" alt="Artist Alistair Debling headshot.">
        <p>To ensure his artwork reflects and resonates with the community in Rye, Alistair is
          particularly interested in hearing local perspectives (from across Rye and Dungeness)
          on what it means (or has meant) to protect the coastline. He’ll be hosting an open
          conversation about the themes of his project and sharing new aerial photography of
          the local landscape. <b>This is your opportunity to help influence the trajectory of
            Alistair’s artwork!</b></p>
