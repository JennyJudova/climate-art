        <summary>Climate Art invites you to join a free drop-in workshop led by Sarah Desmarais – a designer-maker and
          researcher working with slow, sustainable print processes.
          You’ll have the opportunity to try out a centuries-old Japanese resist-printing technique involving stencil
          cutting, printing with a rice paste resist, and indigo dyeing. This slow print process offers a rare
          opportunity to rethink our relationship with fast fashion and the environmental repercussions of textile
          production while reconnecting with the natural world.</summary>
        <img src="textile1.jpg" alt="Example of Textile Printing with Sarah Desmarais.">
        <p>The workshop will be organised in a covid-secure way, out of doors or in a well-ventilated indoor space.
          Suitable for all age groups (children must be supervised).
          All materials will be provided free of charge.</p>

        <summary>Mo Langmuir strives to break down the binary between art and science through collaboration with local
          communities. Alistair Debling examines diverse themes through his interdisciplinary work, from queer nightlife
          and ecology to the military-industrial complex and its architectures.</summary>
        <p>Mo’s work at Climate Art will centre around balloon mapping and marine sampling. Working with Rye’s resident
          groups to map out sites for biological sampling, Mo will use microscopy to generate beautiful interpretations
          of the invisible elements of the local landscape threatened by climate change.</p>
        <img src="mo-behind-scenes.jpeg" alt="Artist Mo Langmuir at work.">
        <p>Mo’s studio is half research lab, half artist atelier, and on 3 May, she’ll
          be opening it up to the public for a virtual tour, sharing methodologies, sampling
          equipment, mapping tools and sketches.</p>
        <p> Alistair’s project will investigate Rye’s rich military history as a fortified town,
          in tandem with its historical and contemporary energy and environmental defence
          infrastructure. This work will help us (re)think what defence, protection and
          fortification of the landscape mean in the age of climate breakdown.</p>
        <img src="alistair-headshot-landscape.jpeg" alt="Artist Alistair Debling headshot.">
        <p>To ensure his artwork reflects and resonates with the community in Rye, Alistair is
          particularly interested in hearing local perspectives (from across Rye and Dungeness)
          on what it means (or has meant) to protect the coastline. He’ll be hosting an open
          conversation about the themes of his project and sharing new aerial photography of
          the local landscape. <b>This is your opportunity to help influence the trajectory of
            Alistair’s artwork!</b></p>
