    <h2>Are We COPing?</h2>
    <h4>Transforming Artistic Engagement Around COP26 and Beyond.</h4>
    <p>
      We are delighted to announce this digital workshop generously supported by
      Creative Carbon Scotland. Created by Matteo Menapace, a game designer formerly
      in residence at the V&amp;A, it will provide a structured format for creative practitioners,
      researchers and policymakers to discuss urgent challenges ahead of the UN Climate
      Change Conference (COP26) due to take place in Glasgow in November 2021.
    </p>
    <p>Set up as a role-playing game, this workshop will enable participants to step out of
      their daily roles and imagine solutions to shared problems. After all, play, as once
      noted by Huizinga, is &#39;older than culture.&#39;</p>
