      <p class="quote-text">We probably have more data on local air quality than anywhere else on the planet. The question is how we use that data to make changes that improve our health. We have a right to breathe clean air in Somers Town.</p>

    <p>Somers Town and the surrounding area have been subject to extensive development from the building of the Euston Road in the 1750s up to today. According to residents,construction has been almost constant since the 1960s and many of the current large-scale development projects are set to continue until 2033.</p>
    <p> The environmental impact over the decades has been severe, with increased air pollution and the loss of much-loved trees that stood for generations. While in recent years there has been some improvement in air quality, the data from local monitoring and sensor networks suggest that the levels of Fine Particles (PM2.5),Ozone (O3), and toxic Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) remain high, with the latter consistently exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) limit for the protection of human health.</p>
    <p>Climate Art proposes a temporary artistic intervention on Chalton Street that would draw attention and offer creative solutions to this daily environmental concern, one that affects everyone but, in particular, vulnerable groups such as older people and young children. Celebrating community-led urban transformation, this installation is also designed to attract visitors to Chalton Street and its open-air market.</p>
    <p>This exhibition showcases the ideas for the future piece envisaged by IVAAIU City and A-Axis Architects (Jihyun Lee, Sung-Su Park, Hancheol So, Hiroto Takeuchi, and Donguk Agos Lee), David Rickard, and Ling Tan and Usman Haque. </p>

      <summary class='names'>About Somers Town</summary>
        <p>Somers Town is an inner-city district in North London that lies between two mainline railway termini, Euston and St Pancras International, and is bound by the Euston Road to the south and Oakley Square and Crowndale Road to the north. While mainly residential, Somers Town is home to some of Britain’s leading research and academic centres, including the British Library and the Francis Crick Institute of biomedical research. It is also moments away from both the UCL campus in Bloomsbury and Kings Cross, home to Central Saint Martins and one of London’s most vibrant tech hubs. </p>
        <p>Somers Town boasts some great examples of interwar-period social housing. The principal design feature of many blocks of flats in the area is the wide-ranging use of site-specific decorative art on façades and in courtyards created by a distinguished British sculptor Gilbert Bayes.</p>
        <p>Today, Somers Town has a truly diverse and tight-knit community with several active neighbourhood groups and associations hosting regular events and an annual festival. However, with high numbers of young and vulnerable residents and several ongoing large-scale construction projects, Somers Town faces pressing social and environmental challenges, ranging from child poverty to the loss of open green spaces. In October 2021, Somers Town was awarded a Future Neighbourhoods status by the GLA to help its residents address some of these issues.</p>
