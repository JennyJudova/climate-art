    <h2>SUPPORT OUR CLIMATE ARTISTS TODAY</h2>
    <p> Donate to Climate Art, and your gift will help to fund some of the most exciting creative practitioners and
      researchers working in the UK today.</p>
    <button onclick="location.href='https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=QBKZPZUUNVE68'">Give via
      PayPal</button>
    <p>Our artists will transform your generosity into innovative sculptures, installations and experiences – sparking
      debates, promoting the environment and changing people’s behaviour to protect the planet. Climate art often uses
      radical materials and cutting-edge techniques, so your donation will leave an impact on art too by showing the
      creative possibilities of sustainability.</p>
    <p>By giving now, you will play a central role in bringing together communities, artists and scientists to shape
      conversations about climate change and what we can all do to solve it. <LinkTo @route="projects">Read all about
        our latest residency</LinkTo>,
      featuring the artists Alistair Debling, Mo Langmuir, and Joseph Williams.</p>
    <p>Whether you choose to give a one-off donation or a regular amount, your gift will help to create the
      environmental art of the future.</p>
